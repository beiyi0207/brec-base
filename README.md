# BREC
Create beautiful, responsive, ergonomic and configurable products with value, function
and appearance benefiting producers and users.

## About
Included are the basics of our framework used throughout Vecna projects. We are sharing
only the parts that are generic enough to be useful to others.

### Base Files
These files are located in /sass/base/. Some modules may depend on base files.
- Grid
- Typography
- Icons

### Modules
These files are located in /sass/modules/. Modules are reusable, encapsulated styles. Some modules depend on the base files above, but modules never depend on each other. To keep your CSS files small, @import only the files you need in your project. Or @import "brec" for the full project.
